.SH NAME
mount.prl_fs \- Parallels Shared Folders file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mount -t prl_fs [-o \fIoptions\fB [,...]]
\fIsf_name dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
Shared Folders Tool is a part of Parallels Tools for Linux. It allows you to
share the host OS directories with virtual machines. As a result, you can access
the same files both from host and guest OSs.
.PP
mount.prl_fs mounts the Parallels Shared Folders (PSF) virtual file system which
is implemented by means of a special Linux kernel module (prl_fs.ko).
.PP
To make a directory accessible in a guest OS, first it must be shared in the
host OS. When shared, each directory gets a "shared folder name" \fIsf_name\fR
which may be treated as a unique directory identifier in PSF. Using the
\fBmount(8)\fR utility, each shared folder \fIfs_name\fR can be mounted to an
arbitrary mount point \fIdir\fR. Note that \fIsf_name\fR is
\fIcase-insensitive\fR.
.PP
An important point to mention is mapping files ownership (user and group)
between the host and guest OSs. Of course, direct "one-to-one" mapping between
different OSs is almost impossible. That's why files ownership is "virtualized":
files in a guest OS get "virtual" (or fake) ownership while in the host OS
ownership is left intact. By default, files in a guest OS mounted shared folder
get root:root ownership. However, you can change this using the \fIuid\fR,
\fIgid\fR, \fIshare\fR, and \fIplain\fR PSF mount options.
.PP
A user is not supposed to mount PSF himself. It is done by the prlfsmountd
utility (another part of Shared Folders Tool). Though, some technical details or
options may change in future.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR uid=\fIUID\fR
Each file located in the shared folder will have the user ID \fIUID\fR.
.TP
.BR gid=\fIGID\fR
Each file located in the shared folder will have the group ID \fIGID\fR.
.TP
.BR share
Files in a shared folder get values of user and group IDs identical to those of
the current process. In other words, a root process will see that files belong
to root, and process with user:group 100:200 will see that files belong to
100:200.
.TP
.BR plain
Pass host raw numeric user and group IDs of file owners to guest. Note that even
if these IDs are valid in host, they may be invalid in guest.
.TP
.BR host_inodes
Passthrough inode numbers. The aim of this option is to have persistent inode
numbers in the guest. This helps some programs to perform better. Note that if
there another filesystems are mounted at the host within the shared folder's
directory tree, they all won't be accessible to avoid collisions on inode
numbers.
.TP
.BR ttl=\fITTL\fR
"Time to live" of volume dentries in kernel in jiffies.
.PP
Other common options of \fBmount(8)\fR, such as \fBnodev\fR, \fBnosuid\fR,
\fBatime\fR, etc. are possible here as well.
